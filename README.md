# Markdown Previewer

Markdown Previewer is the second project for the *Front End Development Libraries* course that is hosted by **FreeCodeCamp**.
For this project, I used **React** which is a JavaScript library for building UIs. The user writes their text within the Editor
component, and the output will then be displayed in the Preview component. The input (the text the user writes) gets parsed into
markdown by Marked.
