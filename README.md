# Markdown Previewer

Markdown Previewer is the second project for the *Front End Development Libraries* course that is hosted by **FreeCodeCamp**.
It utilizes the **React** JavaScript library to build the UI. Furthermore, the program uses **Marked** to parse the user 
input in the Editor component and the parsed markdown will then be displayed in the Preview component.

This project is a part of **FreeCodeCamp** *Front End Development Libraries Course*. While some ideas have been received from
their example project and the instructions have been followed, all the components have been made by me.
